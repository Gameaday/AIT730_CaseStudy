- **Extended Analysis Time**: 10 hours (2.5 hours × 4)

### Revised Plan (3 Models)
- **Core Evaluations**: 6 tasks × 3 models = 18 evaluations
- **Extended Analysis**: 2 tasks × 2 top models = 4 evaluations
- **Total Evaluations**: 22
- **Core Evaluation Time**: 45 hours (2.5 hours × 18)
- **Extended Analysis Time**: 10 hours (2.5 hours × 4)

## Time Savings Breakdown

### Direct Time Reduction
**Core Evaluation Savings**: 15 hours
- Original: 60 hours (24 evaluations)

- Same time allocation maintained

### Adjusted Phase Breakdown

#### Phase 1: Setup and Preparation (15 hours) - **No Change**
- Literature review and baseline research: 8 hours
- Methodology refinement: 4 hours  
- Pilot testing: 3 hours

#### Phase 2: Core Data Collection (60 hours → 55 hours) - **5 Hour Reduction**
- Primary evaluations: 45 hours (was 60 hours)
- Extended analysis: 10 hours (unchanged)
- Initial analysis: 5 hours (unchanged)

#### Phase 3: Analysis and Documentation (10 hours) - **No Change**
- Comprehensive analysis: 6 hours
- Report preparation: 4 hours

### Revised Total Timeline

#### Research Execution Phase
**Original**: 100 hours  
**Revised**: 85 hours  
**Time Savings**: 15 hours

#### Complete Project Timeline
**Original Estimate**: 140-160 hours total  
**Revised Estimate**: 125-145 hours total  
**Time Savings**: 15 hours

## Calendar Time Impact

### Part-Time Graduate Student (15-20 hours/week)
**Original**: 7-10 weeks  
**Revised**: 6-9 weeks  
**Time Savings**: 1 week

### Weekend/Evening Work (10-12 hours/week)  
**Original**: 12-16 weeks  
**Revised**: 10-14 weeks  
**Time Savings**: 2 weeks

### Full-Time Dedication (40 hours/week)
**Original**: 3.5-4 weeks  
**Revised**: 3-3.5 weeks  
**Time Savings**: 0.5 weeks

## Strategic Considerations for 3-Model Approach

### Advantages
1. **Reduced Complexity**: Simpler comparative analysis with fewer variables
2. **Time Efficiency**: 15-hour reduction allows for more thorough analysis per model
3. **Quality Focus**: More time available for detailed evaluation of each model
4. **Lower Cost**: Reduced token usage and potential subscription costs

### Potential Limitations
1. **Reduced Comparative Power**: Fewer data points for statistical analysis
2. **Limited Generalizability**: Smaller sample size for drawing broader conclusions
3. **Competitive Analysis**: May miss important differences that emerge with more models

### Model Selection Strategy for 3-Model Approach

#### Recommended Selection Criteria
1. **Market Leadership**: Choose models with significant market presence
2. **Technical Diversity**: Select models with different underlying architectures
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure reliable access throughout research period
4. **Documentation**: Models with good API documentation and support

#### Suggested 3-Model Combinations

**Option A - Market Leaders**:
- Claude Sonnet (Anthropic)
- GPT-5 (OpenAI) 
- Google Gemini (Google)

**Option B - Diverse Capabilities**:
- Claude Sonnet (strong reasoning)
- GPT-5 (general capability)
- Specialized PM AI tool (if available)

## Revised Research Methodology

### Enhanced Analysis Per Model
With 15 hours saved, consider allocating additional time to:

**Deeper Model Analysis** (5 hours):
- More detailed prompt engineering and optimization
- Multiple runs for consistency testing
- Enhanced qualitative analysis of outputs

**Improved Documentation** (5 hours):
- More comprehensive conversation logs
- Detailed error pattern analysis
- Enhanced real-world applicability assessment

**Statistical Rigor** (5 hours):
- Reliability testing across multiple runs
- Enhanced comparative analysis
- Improved confidence in findings

## Updated Risk Assessment

### Reduced Risks
- **Resource Management**: Lower complexity with fewer models to coordinate
- **Technical Issues**: Fewer potential points of failure
- **Timeline Pressure**: Built-in buffer from time savings

### Maintained Risks
- **Model Availability**: Still dependent on external AI services
- **Literature Requirements**: Academic writing timeline unchanged
- **Quality Standards**: Same academic rigor expected

## Recommendations for 3-Model Implementation

### Phase Optimization
1. **Use Time Savings Strategically**: Invest saved time in methodology refinement
2. **Enhanced Quality Assurance**: More thorough validation of each evaluation
3. **Deeper Analysis**: More comprehensive interpretation of results

### Academic Positioning
1. **Justify Model Selection**: Clearly articulate criteria for choosing 3 specific models
2. **Acknowledge Limitations**: Address reduced sample size in methodology section
3. **Emphasize Depth**: Position as deep comparison rather than broad survey

### Future Research Foundation
1. **Scalable Framework**: Design methodology that could accommodate additional models
2. **Replication Guidance**: Provide clear framework for extending to more models
3. **Baseline Establishment**: Create foundation for larger comparative studies

## Conclusion

**Time Impact**: Reducing to 3 models saves 15 hours from research execution (85 hours vs. 100 hours) and 1-2 weeks from overall timeline.

**Recommended Approach**: Use the time savings to enhance analysis depth and methodology rigor rather than simply shortening the project timeline.

**Academic Viability**: 3-model comparison remains academically valid with proper justification and methodology, while offering practical advantages in execution and resource management.

**Total Revised Timeline**: 125-145 hours over 6-9 weeks for part-time graduate work, maintaining high academic standards while improving project feasibility.
