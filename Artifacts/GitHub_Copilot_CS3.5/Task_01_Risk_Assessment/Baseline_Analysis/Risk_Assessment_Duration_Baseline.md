# Risk Assessment Duration Baseline Analysis

## Project Context
- **Project Type**: Oracle-to-Azure Migration
- **Budget Range**: $2.8M-$3.5M
- **Total Timeline**: 18 months
- **Scope**: Enterprise-wide system modernization

## Industry Standards Research
Based on analysis of enterprise IT project management job postings and industry practices:

### Typical Risk Assessment Durations by Project Size
| Project Size | Budget Range | Typical Duration |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Small        | < $1M        | 1-2 weeks       |
| Medium       | $1M-$2M      | 2-4 weeks       |
| Complex      | $2M+         | 4-8 weeks       |

### Project Complexity Factors
1. **Technical Complexity**: HIGH
   - Multi-system integration (Oracle, Azure, Dynamics 365)
   - Data migration requirements
   - System dependencies
   - Infrastructure changes

2. **Organizational Impact**: HIGH
   - Enterprise-wide changes
   - Multiple stakeholder groups
   - Business process modifications
   - Training requirements

3. **Resource Considerations**: HIGH
   - Multiple specialized skill sets required
   - Coordination across departments
   - Vendor management
   - Change management needs
