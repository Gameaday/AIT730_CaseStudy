## 2. Risk Assessment Metrics

### 2.1 Impact Scale
| Level | Score | Description | Business Impact |
|-------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Critical | 5 | Severe impact on business operations | Project failure, major financial loss, severe reputation damage |
| High | 4 | Significant impact on key objectives | Major delays, significant cost overrun, substantial performance issues |
| Medium | 3 | Moderate impact on objectives | Delays, cost increases, notable performance impact |
| Low | 2 | Minor impact on objectives | Small delays, minor cost impact, limited performance issues |
| Minimal | 1 | Negligible impact | No significant effect on timeline, cost, or performance |

### 2.2 Probability Scale
| Level | Score | Description | Likelihood |
|-------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Very High | 5 | Almost certain to occur | >80% probability |
| High | 4 | Likely to occur | 60-80% probability |
| Medium | 3 | May occur | 40-60% probability |
| Low | 2 | Unlikely to occur | 20-40% probability |
| Very Low | 1 | Rare occurrence | <20% probability |

### 2.3 Risk Priority Matrix
| Impact/Probability | Very Low (1) | Low (2) | Medium (3) | High (4) | Very High (5) |
|-------------------|--------------|----------|------------|-----------|---------------|
| Critical (5) | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 |
| High (4) | 4 | 8 | 12 | 16 | 20 |
| Medium (3) | 3 | 6 | 9 | 12 | 15 |
| Low (2) | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 |
| Minimal (1) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |

Risk Priority Levels:
- Critical (15-25): Immediate action required
- High (9-14): Prompt action needed
- Medium (5-8): Monitoring and planned action
