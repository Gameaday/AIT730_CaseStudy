# Migration Framework and Methodology

## 1. Migration Approach Overview

### 1.1 Core Principles
- **Minimize Business Disruption**: Maintain operations during transition
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure complete and accurate data migration
- **Risk Management**: Phased approach with rollback capabilities
- **Performance Optimization**: Meet or exceed current system performance
- **Security First**: Maintain security and compliance throughout
- **User Experience**: Focus on seamless transition for end users

### 1.2 Migration Strategy Type: Hybrid Parallel Migration
Selected approach based on:
- High business criticality
- Complex data dependencies
- Need for risk mitigation
- 18-month timeline constraint
- $2.8M-$3.5M budget range
