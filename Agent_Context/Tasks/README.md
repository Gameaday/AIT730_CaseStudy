### AI_Evaluation_Tasks.md
**Comprehensive Reference Framework**
- Complete task framework across 8 PM categories
- Updated to reference Legacy System Modernization scenario only
- Available for extended research or broader AI capability assessment
- Not used in the focused 100-hour research scope

## Task Selection Rationale

The core tasks were selected based on:

**High Professional Value**: Each task represents significant professional expertise and time investment, enabling evaluation of AI effectiveness in complex project management activities.

**Professional Relevance**: Tasks represent the most common and challenging project management activities in enterprise environments.

**Differentiation Capability**: Tasks vary in complexity and type to effectively distinguish between AI model capabilities and limitations.

**Real-World Applicability**: All tasks produce deliverables that would be directly usable in professional project management environments.

## Usage Instructions

### For AI Evaluation
1. Use `Core_AI_Evaluation_Tasks.md` for the primary research
2. Reference the Legacy System Modernization scenario and supporting documents
3. Apply standardized evaluation criteria consistently across all models
4. Document time, quality, and practical applicability for each output

### For Extended Research
1. `AI_Evaluation_Tasks.md` provides comprehensive task framework for broader analysis
2. All tasks now reference the unified Legacy System Modernization scenario
3. Can be used for expanded research or deeper capability assessment

## Evaluation Framework

Each task assessed on 1-5 scale:
- **Completeness**: Thoroughness in addressing requirements
- **Accuracy**: Correct application of information and methodologies
- **Quality**: Professional standard and practical applicability
- **Innovation**: Creative insights and value-added recommendations
- **Efficiency**: Time savings compared to human baseline
- **Implementation Readiness**: Real-world usability of deliverables

## Expected Outcomes

- Quantitative comparison of AI model performance
- Time savings analysis demonstrating efficiency gains
- Professional readiness assessment for enterprise use
- Cost-effectiveness evaluation including resource requirements
- Practical recommendations for AI adoption in project management
