# Project Scenario - Legacy System Modernization

## Overview

This folder contains the single comprehensive project scenario used for evaluating agentic AI capabilities in project management contexts.

## Project Scenario

### Legacy System Modernization Project
**File**: `Legacy_System_Modernization.md`

**Project Type**: Enterprise Technology Transformation  
**Duration**: 18 months  
**Budget Range**: $2.8M - $3.5M  
**Complexity Level**: High

**Key Characteristics**:
- Oracle-to-Azure cloud migration for manufacturing company
- Complex stakeholder environment with change resistance
- Technical architecture transformation requirements
- Regulatory compliance and business continuity constraints
- Significant cost optimization opportunity ($354K annual savings)
- Hard deadline pressure (Oracle renewal deadline)

**Evaluation Suitability**:
This scenario provides sufficient complexity across multiple project management domains:
- **Technical Complexity**: Legacy system integration and cloud migration
- **Financial Complexity**: Multi-million dollar investment with ROI requirements
- **Organizational Complexity**: Change management across multiple stakeholder groups
- **Strategic Complexity**: Business transformation with competitive implications
- **Risk Complexity**: High-stakes environment with business continuity requirements

## Usage Instructions

1. **Review the complete scenario document** before beginning any AI evaluation tasks
2. **Use this scenario consistently** across all AI model evaluations to ensure comparability
3. **Reference specific elements** from the scenario when formulating AI prompts
4. **Consider the full context** including business drivers, constraints, and stakeholder dynamics

## Scenario Selection Rationale

This scenario was selected as the sole focus for the research based on:

**Academic Rigor**: Provides sufficient depth and complexity for meaningful AI capability assessment while maintaining focus for thorough analysis within 100-hour research timeline.

**Practical Relevance**: Represents one of the most common and challenging enterprise project types - legacy system modernization - with high real-world applicability.

**AI Differentiation Potential**: Contains elements that will effectively differentiate AI model capabilities across technical analysis, financial planning, stakeholder management, and strategic thinking.

**Professional Applicability**: Results will be directly relevant to project managers working in enterprise environments where similar transformation projects are increasingly common.
