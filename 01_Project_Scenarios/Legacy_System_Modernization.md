# Legacy System Modernization Project Scenario

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Enterprise System Modernization Initiative  
**Organization**: MidCorp Manufacturing Solutions  
**Project Duration**: 18 months  
**Estimated Budget**: $2.8M - $3.5M  
**Project Type**: Technology Infrastructure Modernization

## Business Context

### Current State Pain Points

**Legacy Infrastructure Challenges**:
- Multiple redundant Oracle databases ($180K annual licensing costs)
- 12 physical servers across 3 data centers (high maintenance costs)
- Overlapping ERP, CRM, and inventory management systems
- Manual data synchronization between systems (20+ hours weekly)
- Frequent system outages affecting production (average 8 hours monthly downtime)
- Limited scalability for business growth
- Security vulnerabilities in outdated systems

**Historical Context**:
MidCorp acquired TechFlow Industries in 2019, inheriting their Oracle-based manufacturing execution system. Rather than integrate properly, both systems continued operating in parallel, creating:
- Duplicate vendor management processes
- Conflicting inventory tracking
- Multiple customer databases with inconsistent data
- Complex reporting requiring manual data consolidation
- Excessive licensing costs for underutilized Oracle features

**Current Annual Operational Costs**:
- Oracle licensing and support: $180,000
- Server maintenance and hosting: $95,000
- IT staff overhead for legacy system support: $240,000
- Data synchronization and manual processes: $125,000
- **Total Annual Legacy Costs**: $640,000

### Business Drivers

**Strategic Objectives**:
- Reduce annual IT operational costs by 60% ($384K savings)
- Improve system reliability to 99.5% uptime
- Enable real-time data access across all business functions
- Support 300% business growth over next 5 years
- Enhance cybersecurity posture and compliance
- Enable remote work capabilities for 40% of workforce

**Market Pressures**:
- Competitors using modern cloud platforms gaining market advantage
- Customer demands for real-time order tracking and transparency
- Regulatory compliance requirements for data security and retention
- Supply chain visibility needs for just-in-time manufacturing

## Target Architecture

### Proposed Cloud-Native Solution

**Core Platform Strategy**:
- **Primary Cloud Provider**: Microsoft Azure (existing Office 365 relationship)

- **Integration Platform**: Azure Logic Apps and API Management
- **Analytics Platform**: Power BI with real-time dashboards
- **Security Framework**: Azure Active Directory with multi-factor authentication

**Application Modernization Approach**:
1. **Replace Oracle ERP**: Migrate to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central
2. **Consolidate CRM**: Implement Dynamics 365 Sales (replace 3 existing systems)
3. **Inventory Management**: Custom Azure-based solution with IoT integration
4. **Reporting Platform**: Power BI replacing 5 different reporting tools
5. **Document Management**: SharePoint Online (replace legacy file servers)

**Expected Technical Benefits**:
- 50% reduction in system response times
- Automatic scaling based on demand
- 99.9% uptime SLA from cloud provider
- Integrated security and compliance monitoring
- Mobile access for field personnel
- Real-time analytics and reporting

### Cost Optimization Strategy

**Projected Annual Savings**:
- Oracle licensing elimination: $180,000
- Server hardware and maintenance: $95,000
- Reduced IT support overhead: $144,000 (40% of current)
- Process automation savings: $100,000
- **Total Annual Savings**: $519,000

**New Annual Cloud Costs**:
- Azure infrastructure: $85,000
- Dynamics 365 licenses: $48,000
- Support and maintenance: $32,000
- **Total New Annual Costs**: $165,000
- **Net Annual Savings**: $354,000
