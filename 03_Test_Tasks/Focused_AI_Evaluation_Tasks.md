- Risk score calculation and prioritization matrix
- Detailed response strategies for top 10 risks (avoid, mitigate, transfer, accept)
- Risk owners and target response dates
- Early warning indicators and monitoring approaches
- Risk interdependencies and cascade effects"

**Evaluation Focus**:
- Comprehensive risk identification across multiple domains
- Analytical depth in risk assessment
- Strategic thinking in response planning
