# 100-Hour Graduate Research Design

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the focused research design for evaluating agentic AI capabilities in project management within a 100-hour graduate study timeline, emphasizing research depth and academic rigor.

## Research Design Overview

### Core Research Framework
- **AI Models to Evaluate**: 4 models (Claude Sonnet, Google Gemini, GPT-5, + 1 additional)
- **Project Scenario**: Legacy System Modernization (Oracle-to-Azure cloud migration)
- **Core Evaluation Tasks**: 6 high-value project management activities
- **Extended Analysis**: 2 additional complex tasks for top-performing models
- **Total Research Time**: 100 hours

### Research Approach Rationale
**Single Scenario Focus**: Legacy System Modernization provides sufficient complexity to differentiate AI capabilities across technical, financial, organizational, and strategic domains while enabling deep comparative analysis.

**Task Selection Criteria**: Six tasks selected for their professional significance, complexity, and ability to demonstrate varying AI capabilities in project management contexts.

## Core Task Framework

### Primary Evaluation Tasks (All 4 Models)
1. **Comprehensive Risk Assessment and Mitigation Planning**
   - Tests: Critical thinking, scenario analysis, risk assessment capabilities
   - Output: Systematic analysis requiring both breadth and depth

2. **Detailed Migration Strategy and Implementation Plan**
   - Tests: Analytical decomposition, logical structuring, technical planning knowledge
   - Output: Structured deliverable with clear evaluation criteria

3. **Stakeholder Engagement and Communication Strategy**
   - Tests: Strategic planning, stakeholder management, process design
   - Output: Systematic approach requiring organizational understanding

4. **Vendor Management and Procurement Strategy**
   - Tests: Strategic thinking, vendor analysis, procurement planning
   - Output: Professional framework requiring accuracy and completeness

5. **Cost-Benefit Analysis and Financial Management**
   - Tests: Financial analysis, business case development, quantitative reasoning
   - Output: Professional financial analysis requiring accuracy and completeness

6. **Quality Assurance and Testing Strategy**
   - Tests: Process design, systematic thinking, quality management knowledge
   - Output: Procedural framework requiring completeness and practicality

### Extended Analysis (Top 2 Models Only)
7. **Enterprise Architecture and Integration Design**
   - Advanced technical planning task for deeper capability assessment

8. **Organizational Change Management Program**
   - Complex change management task requiring integration of multiple PM domains

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Setup and Baseline (10 hours)
- Finalize supporting documents
- Create standardized evaluation templates
- Establish testing environment and procedures
- Conduct pilot test with 1 task and 1 model

### Phase 2: Core Evaluation (60 hours)
- Execute 6 core tasks across all 4 models
- Document results using standardized templates
- Conduct initial comparative analysis
- Identify top 2 performing models

### Phase 3: Extended Analysis (10 hours)
- Execute 2 additional complex tasks with top 2 models
- Deep-dive analysis of advanced capabilities
- Comparative assessment of model strengths/weaknesses

### Phase 4: Analysis and Documentation (20 hours)
- Comprehensive comparative analysis
- Real-world applicability assessment
- Academic paper/report writing
- Conclusions and recommendations

## Quality Assurance Measures

### Standardization
- Identical prompts across all models
- Consistent evaluation criteria and scoring
- Standardized documentation templates
- Time tracking for efficiency analysis

### Academic Rigor
- Literature review integration
- Methodology documentation
- Bias identification and mitigation
- Reproducible research design

### Practical Relevance
- Industry-standard deliverable expectations
- Real-world applicability assessment
- Professional PM practitioner validation
- Cost-benefit analysis inclusion

## Expected Outcomes

### Quantitative Results
- Comparative performance scores across 6 dimensions
- Efficiency metrics (time to completion)
- Accuracy and completeness measurements
- Cost analysis (token usage where applicable)

### Qualitative Insights
- Model-specific strengths and limitations
- Task complexity vs. AI capability mapping
- Professional readiness assessment
- Implementation recommendations

### Academic Contributions
- Novel comparison framework for AI PM tools
- Practical applicability assessment methodology
- Evidence-based recommendations for AI adoption in PM
- Foundation for future research directions

## Risk Mitigation

### Scope Creep Prevention
- Fixed task list with no additions during execution
- Predetermined evaluation criteria
- Time boxing for each evaluation session
- Regular progress tracking against timeline

### Quality Maintenance
- Pilot testing to refine procedures
- Standardized evaluation protocols
- Independent validation of scoring
- Documentation of all decisions and changes

### Technical Risks
- Backup plans for AI model availability issues
- Alternative task formulations if initial prompts fail
- Contingency time allocation (10% buffer)
- Multiple output format preparations

## Conclusion

The focused research design with 6 core tasks provides optimal balance of:
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests key PM domains
- **Comparative Depth**: All models evaluated on same tasks
- **Academic Rigor**: Sufficient data for meaningful analysis
- **Practical Relevance**: Focus on essential PM activities
- **Timeline Feasibility**: Achievable within 100-hour constraint

This design ensures a high-quality graduate-level research project that provides actionable insights while maintaining academic standards and practical applicability.
