## Risk Factors and Mitigation

### High-Risk Factors
1. **AI Model Availability**: Ensure backup access to alternative models
2. **Literature Availability**: Secure library access and interlibrary loan capabilities
3. **Technical Issues**: Build in buffer time for unexpected technical challenges
4. **Scope Creep**: Maintain strict adherence to defined research scope

### Mitigation Strategies

4. **Regular Documentation**: Maintain detailed notes throughout research execution

### For Quality Assurance
1. **Incremental Review**: Regular check-ins with advisor/supervisor
2. **Peer Feedback**: Share methodology and preliminary findings with colleagues
3. **Citation Management**: Use tools like Zotero or Mendeley from the beginning
4. **Version Control**: Systematic backup and version management

## Conclusion

**Most Likely Timeline**: 140-160 total hours over 7-10 weeks for a part-time graduate student, resulting in a high-quality research project with comprehensive citations and academic rigor.

**Critical Success Factors**: 
- Early literature review initiation
