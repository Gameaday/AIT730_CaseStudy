# AIT730 Case Study: Agentic AI in Project Management

## Research Overview

This repository contains a focused case study examining the capabilities and effectiveness of agentic AI technologies in project management contexts. The research evaluates how well current AI tools can perform complex, time-intensive project management tasks that traditionally require significant human expertise and experience.

## Research Question

**Primary Research Question**: How effectively can agentic AI technologies provide significant time savings while maintaining professional quality in complex project management tasks?

**Secondary Research Questions**:
- What are the strengths and limitations of different AI models in handling time-intensive PM tasks?
- Which complex project management activities offer the greatest potential for AI-driven efficiency gains?
- What is the practical readiness of AI tools for professional project management environments?
- How do different AI models compare in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and real-world applicability?

## Research Scope (100-Hour Graduate Study)

**Models to Evaluate**: Claude Sonnet, Google Gemini, GPT-5, [Fourth Model TBD]  
**Core Tasks**: 6 high-value, time-intensive PM activities  
**Extended Analysis**: 2 additional complex tasks for top-performing models  
**Focus**: Research how AI time efficiency compares to traditional project management approaches

## Repository Structure

### 01_Project_Scenarios/
Contains one comprehensive project scenario representing complex enterprise transformation:
- **Legacy System Modernization**: Oracle-to-Azure cloud migration for manufacturing company
  - Complex technical architecture transformation
  - Multi-million dollar budget with significant cost optimization potential  
  - High-risk stakeholder environment with change resistance
  - Regulatory compliance and business continuity requirements
  - 18-month timeline with hard deadline constraints

**Scenario Selection Rationale**: Represents common enterprise challenge (legacy modernization) with sufficient complexity to differentiate AI capabilities across technical, financial, organizational, and strategic domains.

### 02_Supporting_Documents/

- Company profiles and organizational context
- Talent pool and resource availability
- Customer requirements and stakeholder needs  
- Project requests and business drivers
- Bid requirements and technical specifications
- Market information and competitive landscape

**Simplification Rationale**: Reduced complexity to focus on core information needed for AI evaluation while avoiding excessive detail that would obscure AI reasoning capabilities.

6. **Quality Assurance and Testing Strategy** (research baseline duration and cite appropriately)

**Extended Tasks** (Top 2 Models - 2 Tasks):
7. **Enterprise Architecture and Integration Design** (research baseline duration and cite appropriately)
8. **Organizational Change Management Program** (research baseline duration and cite appropriately)

**Task Selection Criteria**: Focus on high-value activities requiring significant professional expertise and time investment.

### 04_Templates_Standards/
Industry-standard templates, forms, and documentation formats commonly used in project management.

### 05_Evaluation_Framework/
Criteria, metrics, and evaluation tools for assessing AI performance on project management tasks.

### 06_AI_Products/
Systematic capture and analysis framework for AI tool results:
- Individual AI tool folders with standardized organization
- Task output capture by PM category
- Conversation logs and iteration tracking
- Performance analysis templates and scoring
- Limitations documentation and pattern identification  
- Cost analysis and token usage tracking
- Real-world applicability assessments

**Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation and analysis of AI tool performance across all evaluation dimensions for academic research and practical assessment.

## Research Methodology

**Phase 1** (15 hours): Setup, standardization, pilot testing  
**Phase 2** (75 hours): Execute 6 core tasks across 4 models (24 evaluations)  
**Phase 3** (10 hours): Extended analysis with top 2 models (4 evaluations)  
**Total**: 100 hours within 7-week graduate research timeline

### Evaluation Framework
Each task assessed on 1-5 scale across:
1. **Completeness**: Thoroughness in addressing requirements
2. **Accuracy**: Correct application of information and methodologies  
3. **Quality**: Professional standard and practical applicability
4. **Innovation**: Creative insights and value-added recommendations
5. **Efficiency**: Time and resource requirements compared to traditional project management approaches (research baseline durations and cite appropriately)
6. **Implementation Readiness**: Real-world usability of deliverables

### Expected Outcomes
- Quantitative performance comparison across AI models
- Time and efficiency analysis comparing AI to traditional approaches
- Professional readiness assessment for enterprise PM environments
- Cost-effectiveness evaluation including token usage analysis
- Practical implementation recommendations for AI adoption in PM
