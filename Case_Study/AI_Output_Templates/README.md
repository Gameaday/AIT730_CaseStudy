# AI Products and Outputs Repository

## Overview

This directory contains the outputs, documentation, and analysis results from testing various agentic AI tools on project management tasks. Each AI tool has its own subdirectory containing all generated content, performance metrics, and evaluation data.

## AI Tool Organization

### Naming Convention
Directories should follow this format: `AI_Model_Name_Version`

Examples:
- `ChatGPT_4o_20240806`
- `Claude_3.5_Sonnet_20240620`
- `Gemini_Pro_1.5_20240801`
- `GPT-4_Turbo_20240409`

### Required Documentation

#### Individual AI Tool Folders
Each AI tool folder must contain:

1. **Task_Outputs/**: Organized by task category with actual AI-generated deliverables
2. **Conversation_Logs/**: Complete conversation histories including prompts and responses
3. **Performance_Analysis.md**: Detailed evaluation results using the framework
4. **Limitations_Issues.md**: Documented problems, errors, and limitations encountered
5. **Cost_Token_Analysis.md**: Token usage and associated costs for each task
6. **Real_World_Applicability.md**: Assessment of practical usability in professional contexts

#### Parent Directory Files
1. **AI_Comparison_Summary.md**: Side-by-side comparison of all tested AI tools
2. **Cost_Analysis_Summary.md**: Comprehensive cost-benefit analysis across all tools
3. **Performance_Metrics_Dashboard.md**: Aggregated performance metrics and visualizations

## Data Collection Guidelines

### Task Output Requirements
- Save all AI-generated deliverables in original format
- Include timestamps and version information
- Document any iterations or refinements made
- Note any prompts or clarifications required

### Conversation Log Standards
- Capture complete conversation threads
- Include initial prompts, AI responses, and follow-up questions
- Document any clarification requests from the AI
- Note response times and any system errors

### Performance Tracking
- Use standardized evaluation framework scores (1-5 scale)
- Document completion times for each task
- Track iterations required to achieve acceptable quality
- Record user satisfaction with outputs

### Cost Documentation
- Track token usage for each individual task
- Calculate costs based on current pricing models
- Include setup/context tokens and output tokens separately
- Document any API rate limiting or usage restrictions

## File Naming Conventions

### Task Outputs
Format: `TaskID_TaskName_YYYYMMDD_Version.ext`
Example: `T1.1_Project_Charter_20250825_v1.docx`

### Conversation Logs
Format: `TaskID_ConversationLog_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.txt`
Example: `T1.1_ConversationLog_20250825_1430.txt`

### Analysis Files
Use descriptive names with dates:
- `Performance_Analysis_20250825.md`
- `Limitations_Summary_20250825.md`
- `Token_Usage_Report_20250825.md`

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Requirements
- All outputs must be reviewed against evaluation criteria
- Performance scores must be documented with justification
- Cost calculations must be verified and cross-checked
- Conversation logs must be complete and accurate

### Version Control
- Track all changes to analysis files
- Maintain backup copies of original AI outputs
- Document any post-processing or editing performed
- Use version numbers for iterative improvements

## Research Protocol

### Testing Sequence
1. Prepare standardized prompts for each task
2. Execute tasks in consistent order across all AI tools
3. Document immediate observations and issues
4. Collect complete conversation logs and outputs
5. Perform detailed evaluation using framework criteria
6. Calculate costs and performance metrics
7. Analyze real-world applicability and limitations

### Consistency Measures
- Use identical prompts across all AI tools when possible
- Test under similar conditions (time of day, system load)
- Apply evaluation criteria consistently
- Document any deviations from standard protocol

## Analysis and Reporting

### Individual Tool Analysis
Each AI tool analysis should address:
- Task completion quality and accuracy
- Efficiency and speed of delivery
- Innovation and insight demonstrated
- Practical applicability for project managers
- Cost-effectiveness and value proposition
- Limitations and areas for improvement

### Comparative Analysis
Cross-tool comparison should evaluate:
- Relative strengths and weaknesses
- Best use cases for each tool
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Integration potential with existing workflows
- Scalability and enterprise readiness

### Final Recommendations
Research conclusions should provide:
- Overall ranking of AI tools for PM tasks
- Specific recommendations for different use cases
- Implementation guidance for organizations
- Future research directions and opportunities

## Data Privacy and Ethics

### Sensitive Information
- Remove any actual company data from examples
- Use only the provided fictional scenarios
- Ensure no personally identifiable information in logs
- Follow academic research ethics guidelines

### AI Tool Usage
- Respect terms of service for all AI platforms
- Document any limitations on commercial use
- Acknowledge AI tool contributions in research
- Maintain transparency about methodology and limitations
